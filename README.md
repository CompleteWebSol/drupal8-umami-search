# Umami demo search

This project is an implementation of umami to be used as a demo.

This code is hosted on [drupalsear.ch](http://drupalsear.ch). This provides an example of what can be achieved with a basic setup of Search API, Search API db, and Facets.

The site can be installed locally as follows:
Run `install.sh` from the root of the directory:

```
scripts/install.sh
```
